# E-Portfolio Website
## [shahdivyank.github.io](https://shahdivyank.github.io)

A minimalist website, taking inspiration from Apple's colors, displaying information regarding past experiences, projects, and methods to contact me. Built using HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery. With a color scheme toggler, users can toggle between LIGHT mode or DARK mode or select AUTO to use system settings.
